# Train Schedule Application

This Train Schedule Application allows users to view train schedules based on processed data retrieved from the backend server. The data processing for the train schedule is performed on the backend server, enabling complex calculations, filtering, and data manipulation based on specified conditions. By offloading these tasks to the backend, the client application can focus on rendering the schedule and providing a responsive interface.

## Backend Data Processing

The backend server performs data processing for the train schedule, including complex calculations, filtering, and data manipulation. This server-side processing allows for efficient handling of large datasets and computationally intensive operations. The backend server ensures that the processed data is optimized and ready for consumption by the frontend application.

## Seamless Frontend Experience

The frontend application, built using React, receives the processed data from the backend server and presents it to users in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. The frontend application is responsible for rendering the train schedule, providing interactive features, and delivering a seamless user experience.

## Token Expiration and Authentication

To ensure secure communication between the frontend and backend, the application utilizes access tokens for authentication. These tokens have a limited lifespan (expiration time) for security purposes. The backend server is responsible for handling token expiration and authentication.

When a request is made to the backend for train schedule data, the backend server first checks if the access token is still valid. If the token has expired or is close to expiration, the backend server initiates the authentication process by making a request to the authentication API endpoint.

The backend server securely exchanges the client credentials (company name, client ID, owner name, etc.) with the authentication API endpoint to obtain a fresh access token. Once the new access token is obtained, the backend server uses it to authenticate subsequent requests to the train schedule data API.

By handling token expiration and authentication on the backend, the frontend application is shielded from the complexities of the authentication process. The frontend can focus on rendering the train schedule and providing a seamless user experience, without having to handle token expiration or request new tokens.

This approach enhances security by preventing exposure of access tokens to the frontend and ensures that the backend maintains control over authentication and token management.

## Benefits

- **Efficient Data Processing:** Backend server-side processing enables complex calculations, filtering, and data manipulation, resulting in optimized and accurate train schedule data.
- **Responsive User Interface:** The frontend application focuses on rendering the schedule, providing interactive features, and delivering a seamless user experience.
- **Enhanced Security:** Access tokens are used for authentication, ensuring secure communication between the frontend and backend. Automatic token renewal prevents interruptions in accessing the train schedule data.
- **Scalability and Performance:** By offloading data processing to the backend, the application can efficiently handle large datasets and computationally intensive operations, resulting in improved scalability and performance.

## Getting Started

To set up the Train Schedule Application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up and configure the backend server, ensuring it performs the necessary data processing for the train schedule.
3. Customize the frontend React application as needed, connecting it to the backend server and handling token expiration scenarios.
4. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Start the frontend application using `npm start`.
6. Access the application in your web browser.
