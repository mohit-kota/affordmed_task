# Train Schedule Application

This Train Schedule Application is designed to display train schedules based on processed data retrieved from a backend server. The backend server is responsible for processing the data according to specific conditions and sending the processed information to the frontend application. This approach minimizes the load on the client-side, ensuring a smoother user experience.

## Backend Processing

The data processing for the train schedule is performed on the backend server. This server-side processing allows for complex calculations, filtering, and data manipulation based on the specified conditions. By offloading these tasks to the backend, the client application can focus on rendering the schedule and providing a responsive interface.

## Seamless Frontend Experience

The frontend application, built using React, receives the pre-processed data from the backend server and presents it to the users in an intuitive and visually appealing manner. The processed data includes train names, numbers, departure times, available seats, prices, and any delays. Users can easily view the schedule and make informed decisions based on the presented information.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Client-side Load:** With the data processing performed on the backend, the client application is lightweight and responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Efficient Data Presentation:** By receiving pre-processed data from the backend, the frontend can directly focus on rendering the schedule without performing complex calculations or manipulations.
- **Improved Performance:** Offloading the processing to the backend allows for optimized performance, especially when dealing with large datasets or computationally intensive operations.

## Getting Started

To set up the Train Schedule Application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up and start the backend server, ensuring it handles the data processing as specified.
3. Configure the frontend React application to connect with the backend server. Update the API endpoint URL in the appropriate files.
4. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Start the frontend application using `npm start`.
6. Access the application in your web browser.

Please refer to the documentation and project files for detailed instructions on setting up and customizing the Train Schedule Application according to your requirements.
